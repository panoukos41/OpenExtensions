Thanks for installing OpenExtansions!

If you used the alpha version the biggest changes you will see is to namespaces,
this is due to me being unable to decide on some things but after a lot of reading online and seeing other projects as examples
i decided on these namespaces. You will also see that anything related to MVVM is under the MVVM namespace and now all commands are included.

Android resources will be removed in a future release and will be available at OpenExtensions.Droid.UI package.
