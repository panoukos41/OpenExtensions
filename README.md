# OpenExtensions

The goal is like the name, to have a library containing extensions open for everyone to contribute and use.
Make extensions for everything C# to make our life easier from WPF, UWP to Android, IOS, .Net Standard and .Net Core.

# Keep in mind

The library now contains extensions for the things i have worked on that being UWP and Xamarin.Android, it extends things from MvvmLight and contains code from [Prism.Windows](https://github.com/PrismLibrary/Prism/tree/7.1.0-pre4/Source/Windows10/Prism.Windows) branch since prism has abandoned UWP for now. One of my goals was to keep it compatible with UWP Anniversary update 14393 to use it on my app, of course this can change when the need comes to but I would really love the lowest platform version possible for each platform.
