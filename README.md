## OpenExtensions

The goal is like the name, to have a library containing extensions open for everyone to contribute and use. 
1. Make extensions for everything C# to make our life easier from WPF, UWP to Android and IOS
2. Everything from classes to extension methods, we should try and keep most of the classes separated from each other and when possible to provide interfaces for anyone to build their own implementation if necessary.


Nuget Package:

***Things to start with***
1. Tests need to be made, i am not really familiar with testing in a library any knowledge and guidance is appreciated.
2. Samples need to be made too.

> This is my first library, i will appreciate any help specifically for the naming convention of namespaces and separation of things like UI controls and interfaces to separate nugget packages if needed.

> The library now contains extensions for the things i have worked on, UWP and Xamarin.Android, it extends things from MvvmLight and contains code from Prism windows branch since prism has abandoned UWP for now, Everyone is welcome to help and extend this SDK type library.
